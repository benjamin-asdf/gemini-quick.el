* Concept

- I recently used to open LLM chat and paste text a lot.
- This is for automating this process and get the output in an emacs buffer.

* Usage

- You need to set =gemini-api-key= to a function with no args
  returning a gemini api key.

  Example:

#+begin_src elisp
  (setf gemini-api-key
        (let ((s))
    (lambda ()
      (setf s (shell-command-to-string "pass gai/gemini-api-key-1")))))
#+end_src

- Use =quick-gemini-chat=
